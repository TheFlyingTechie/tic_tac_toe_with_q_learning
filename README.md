# tic_tac_toe_with_q_learning

This is the code for my latest series on Instagram. Each week, I will update and add code. 

This repository will eventually contain an evvironment, and agnet, and the driver code. The environment isn't specialised for the agent, thus you can use it on your own algorithms.

The environment class doesn't have a set size for the board. This means you can have a board of any size, and it will still calculate the winner, as well as print the board correctly.
